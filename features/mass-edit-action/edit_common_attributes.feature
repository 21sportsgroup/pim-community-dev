  In order to update the same information on many products
  As Julia
  I need to be able to edit some common attributes of many products at once

  Background:
    Given a "lamp" product
    And a "ceiling" product
    And a "torch" product
    And the following attribute group:
      | name    |
      | General |
    And the following product attributes:
      | product | label  | group   | translatable | scopable | type        |
      | lamp    | Name   | General | yes          | no       | text        |
      | ceiling | Name   | General | yes          | no       | text        |
      | torch   | Name   | General | yes          | no       | text        |
      | lamp    | Colors | General | no           | no       | multiselect |

    Then I should see "Product(s) attribute(s) have been updated"
    And the prices "Price" of products lamp and torch should be:
      | amount | currency |
      | 100    | USD      |
